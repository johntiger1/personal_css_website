Some teardown review/results:

1. We looked at Flexbox. Flexbox is a new way of laying out elements. It avoids the use of:  This is a great guide for bootstrap:. Flexbox's main idea is that you can control row/column right from a single option in the CSS! There is a main axis and cross axis (horizontal and vertical by default). These can be switched by doing display: column for example.

2. We looked at Bootstrap. Bootstrap is a front-end framework that is for responsive design, but at the same time provides a rich ecosystem of pre-made components and fixtures to rapidly prototype designs, without having to go through the intricacies of CSS

3. We looked at jquery/javascript type solutions to solve front end issues

4. Ultimately, we concluded that: if you want to get something looking nice on the web, just follow someone else's tutorial/guide exactly; otherwise it will be hard. Or more "profoundly": a lot of GOOD looking websites are just made by hacking together so much stuff.

"Even a simple sidebar layout is, technically speaking, a little bit of a hack. Flexbox was invented to break out of these limitations."



The key idea behind CSS frameworks seems to be:
